# 🏢 Organization Management Implementation Summary

## ✅ Completed Features

### 1. **Core Infrastructure**

#### tRPC Organization Router (`lib/trpc/routers/organizations.ts`)

Complete API for organization management:

- ✅ `getUserOrganizations` - List all user's organizations
- ✅ `getOrganization` - Get single org details with permissions
- ✅ `createOrganization` - Create new organization via Clerk
- ✅ `updateOrganization` - Update org name (admin only)
- ✅ `uploadOrganizationLogo` - Upload org logo to Vercel Blob (max 2MB)
- ✅ `deleteOrganizationLogo` - Remove org logo (admin only)
- ✅ `getOrgMembers` - List members with user details
- ✅ `inviteMember` - Send Clerk invitation (admin only)
- ✅ `removeMember` - Remove member (admin only, prevents removing last admin)
- ✅ `updateMemberRole` - Change member role (admin only, prevents demoting last admin)

#### Custom Hooks

- ✅ `hooks/use-organizations.ts` - Fetch and create organizations
- ✅ `hooks/use-active-organization.ts` - Active org management with localStorage + URL slug sync
- ✅ `hooks/use-org-members.ts` - Member management (list, remove, update roles)
- ✅ `hooks/use-org-invitation.ts` - Invite members

#### Utilities

- ✅ `lib/utils.ts` - Added `getInitials()` for generating avatar initials from names

---

### 2. **User Interface**

#### Sidebar Organization Switcher (`components/sidebar-org-switcher.tsx`)

- ✅ Dropdown showing all user's organizations
- ✅ Display org logo or initials fallback
- ✅ Active organization indicator (blue dot)
- ✅ "Organization Settings" link
- ✅ "Create Workspace" button
- ✅ Workspace count display
- ✅ Skeleton loading state

#### Updated Components

- ✅ `components/app-sidebar.tsx` - Now uses `SidebarOrgSwitcher` instead of static header
- ✅ `components/nav-user.tsx` - Now uses `getInitials()` for user avatar fallback

---

### 3. **Onboarding Flow**

#### Sign-Up Configuration

- ✅ `app/(logged-out)/sign-up/[[...sign-up]]/page.tsx` - Redirects to `/onboarding` after signup
- ✅ `middleware.ts` - Allows authenticated access to `/onboarding`

#### Onboarding Page (`app/(logged-out)/onboarding/page.tsx`)

- ✅ Clean, single-step organization creation form
- ✅ Validates organization name (1-100 characters)
- ✅ Auto-redirects if user already has organizations
- ✅ Creates organization via Clerk API
- ✅ Waits for webhook sync (1.5s delay)
- ✅ Redirects to `/org/{slug}/dashboard` after creation

---

### 4. **Organization Settings**

#### Settings Layout (`app/(logged-in)/org/[slug]/settings/layout.tsx`)

- ✅ Sidebar navigation with tabs
- ✅ "General" and "Members" tabs
- ✅ Clean, modern UI with proper spacing

#### General Settings (`app/(logged-in)/org/[slug]/settings/page.tsx`)

**Components:**

- ✅ **`org-general-form.tsx`** - Update organization name
  - Validates name changes
  - Syncs to Clerk
  - Invalidates queries for instant UI update
  - Disabled state while saving

- ✅ **`org-logo-upload.tsx`** - Manage organization logo

  - Shows org initials as fallback
  - Delete logo functionality
  - File validation (type + size)
  - Loading states for upload/delete
  - Base64 conversion for tRPC transmission

#### Members Page (`app/(logged-in)/org/[slug]/settings/members/page.tsx`)

**Components:**

- ✅ **`org-member-list.tsx`** - Member table
  - Shows avatar (image or initials)
  - Displays email, role badge
  - "You" indicator for current user
  - Admin badge with shield icon
  - Dropdown menu for admin actions:
    - Make Admin / Remove Admin

  - Email input with validation
  - Role selection (Admin/Member)
  - Sends Clerk invitation email
  - Success/error toasts
  - Form reset after success

---

### 5. **Organization Dashboard**

#### Dashboard Page (`app/(logged-in)/org/[slug]/dashboard/page.tsx`)

- ✅ Redirects to `/dashboard` (temporary)
- ✅ Ready for future org-specific dashboard implementation

---

## 🔧 Technical Implementation Details

### **Organization Slug in URL**

- Active organization slug is stored in localStorage
- URL pattern: `/org/{slug}/settings`, `/org/{slug}/dashboard`
- Automatic URL sync when switching organizations
- If user navigates to different org slug, active org updates

### **Permission Checks**

- ✅ Only admins can access organization settings
- ✅ Only admins can invite/remove members
- ✅ Only admins can update organization name/logo
- ✅ Only admins can change member roles
- ✅ Prevents removing or demoting the last admin

### **Avatar System**

- Organization logos: Display logo image or first 2 letters of org name
- User avatars: Display profile image or initials from display name
- Initials generation:
  - Single word: First 2 letters (e.g., "Acme" → "AC")
  - Multiple words: First letter of first 2 words (e.g., "Acme Corp" → "AC")

### **Data Sync Strategy**

1. User creates/updates organization via tRPC
2. tRPC calls Clerk API to make the change
3. Clerk sends webhook to `/api/clerk/webhook`
4. Webhook handler syncs changes to local database
5. Frontend invalidates React Query cache
6. UI updates automatically

## 🚀 Next Steps

### **Required: Configure Clerk Dashboard**

1. **Enable Organizations Feature**
   - Go to [Clerk Dashboard](https://dashboard.clerk.com)
   - Select your application
   - Navigate to "Organizations" in sidebar
   - Enable the Organizations feature
   - Configure settings:
     - ✅ Allow users to create organizations
     - ✅ Enable organization invitations
     - Set default roles: `org:admin`, `org:member`

2. **Webhook Configuration**
   - Ensure your webhook endpoint is configured: `/api/clerk/webhook`
   - Enable these events (already handled in code):
     - `organization.created`
     - `organization.updated`
     - `organization.deleted`
     - `organizationMembership.created`
     - `organizationMembership.updated`
     - `organizationMembership.deleted`
     - `organizationInvitation.created`
     - `organizationInvitation.accepted`

3. **Environment Variables**
   - Verify `CLERK_SECRET_KEY` is set
   - Verify `NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` is set
   - Verify `CLERK_WEBHOOK_SECRET` is set (for webhook verification)

---

### **Optional: Organization-Aware Tasks**

The task system schema already supports `organizationId`, but the UI doesn't filter by active organization yet.

**To implement:**

1. Update `lib/trpc/routers/tasks.ts` to filter by active organization
2. Modify `hooks/use-tasks.ts` to pass active organization ID
3. Update task creation to include `organizationId`

## 🐛 Known Limitations

1. **Task System**: Not yet organization-aware (existing tasks not filtered by org)
2. **Dashboard**: `/org/{slug}/dashboard` redirects to `/dashboard` (placeholder)
3. **Billing**: Not yet migrated to organization-level subscriptions
4. **Invitations**: Expiry handled by Clerk's default settings
5. **Organization Deletion**: Not implemented (requires Clerk API call + cascade delete)
