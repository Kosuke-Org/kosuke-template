### Custom Roles

You can define custom roles in Clerk dashboard with fine-grained permissions.

## Organization Context

### Server Components

```typescript
import { auth } from '@clerk/nextjs';

export default async function Page() {
  const { orgId, orgRole } = auth();

  // orgId: Current organization ID
  // orgRole: User's role in organization

  if (!orgId) {
    return <SelectOrganization />;
  }

  return <OrganizationDashboard />;
}
```

### Client Components

```typescript
'use client';
import { useOrganization } from '@clerk/nextjs';

export function Component() {
  const { organization, membership } = useOrganization();

  if (!organization) {
    return <NoOrganization />;
  }

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>{organization.name}</h1>
      <p>Your role: {membership.role}</p>
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Organization Switching

Users can switch between organizations using the organization switcher component.

### Switching Context

When a user switches organizations:

1. All subsequent requests use new organization context
2. Data is filtered by new organization
3. Permissions update based on role in new organization

## Data Isolation

All organization data is automatically isolated:

```typescript
// Queries automatically filtered by organization
const data = await db.select().from(projects).where(eq(projects.organizationId, orgId));
```

## Organization Subscriptions

Organizations can have their own subscriptions:

- Billing attached to organization
- All members benefit from organization plan
- Only admins can manage billing

## Best Practices

### 1. Always Check Organization Context

```typescript
const { orgId } = auth();
if (!orgId) {
  return <SelectOrganization />;
}
```

### 2. Verify Permissions

```typescript
const { orgRole } = auth();
if (orgRole !== 'admin') {
  return <div>Admin only</div>;
}
```

### 3. Filter Data by Organization

```typescript
// Always include organization filter
.where(eq(table.organizationId, orgId))
```
